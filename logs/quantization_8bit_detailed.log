[Output]
To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate:

1. The total number of eggs laid each day.
2. Subtract the amount eaten from the total (breakfast + muffins).
3. Multiply the remaining number of eggs by the price per egg ($2).

Let's do these calculations:

1. Total number of eggs:
   - Eggs laid per day = 16
   - Breakfast (three) = 3
   - Muffins baked (four) = 4
   - Eggs sold = 16 - (3 + 4)
   - Remaining eggs = 16 - (3 + 4)

2. Calculate the remaining number of eggs after subtracting the breakfast and muffins from the total:
   - Remaining eggs = 16 - (3 + 4)
   - Remaining eggs = 9

3. Calculate the total earnings from selling the remaining eggs at the farmers' market:
   - Price per egg = $2
   - Earnings = Remaining eggs * Price per egg
   - Earnings = 9 * $2

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.
