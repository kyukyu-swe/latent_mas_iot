[Output]
First, let's calculate how many eggs Janet lays daily:

- Eggs laid from breakfast = 3 (morning)
- Eggs baked = 4 (every day)
- Total eggs laid daily = 3 + 4 = 7 eggs

Next, we need to determine how many eggs Janet sells daily:

- Total eggs laid daily = 7
- Eggs sold daily = Total eggs laid - Eggs laid from breakfast = 7 - 3 = 4 eggs

Finally, we calculate the total earnings at the farmers' market:

- Price per egg = $2
- Eggs sold daily = 4
- Earnings per day = Eggs sold daily × Price per egg = 4 × $2 = $8

Therefore, Janet makes $8 every day at the farmers' market.

Result: Pred=8 | Gold=18 | OK=False
